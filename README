== YAML

This is the pure Perl 6 implementation of YAML.

    use YAML;
    say dump($any_perl_object);

== BENEFITS

At this point in Perl 6, using YAML is the only way to dump an object
graph to text. The `.perl` method will stop at object nodes, rather than
dumping them further. The `.perl` method also cannot dump cyclic data
graphs. YAML.pm handles these things fine.

== CAVEATS

At this early point in time, only the dump() operation is supported. You
cannot use this module to load YAML streams into memory objects.

Also, this early version of YAML.pm should only be used for
_visualizing_ (dumping) complex data. The output quite possibly might
not be perfectly valid YAML, so don't use this module for data
communication just yet.

== INSTALLATION

Use `ufo`. http://github.com/masak/ufo

    > cd yaml-pm6
    > ufo
    > make test    # requires testml - http://github.com/ingydotnet/testml-pm6
    > make install
